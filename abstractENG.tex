The C language is one of the most versatile programming language, yet its confusing syntax and case sensitivity can scare off potential learners. By integrating the gamification aspect into the learning process itself, we hope to create an effective way of learning the C programming language for learners that are interested. Statistical data, key findings, and conclusion will be added later on when the project is near its completion.
